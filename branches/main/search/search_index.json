RSpec\u2019s runner will eventually capture this error and hand it to the reporter, which will display it via <code>RSpec::Core::Formatters::ExceptionPresenter</code>.</p> <p>Given this, there are a few things that SuperDiff needs to do in order to integrate fully with RSpec.</p> <ol> <li>First,    SuperDiff needs to get RSpec to use its differ instead of its own.    Unfortunately, while RSpec is very configurable,    it does not allow its differ to be substituted,    so the gem needs to do some amount of patching in order to achieve this.</li> <li>Second,    the gem needs to provide intelligent diffing    for all kinds of built-in matchers.    Many matchers in RSpec are marked as non-diffable \u2014    their <code>#diffable?</code> method returns <code>false</code> \u2014    causing RSpec to not show a diff after the matcher\u2019s failure message    in the failure output.    The <code>contain_exactly</code> matcher is one such example.    SuperDiff turns this on \u2014    but the only way to do this is via patching.</li> <li>Lastly,    SuperDiff also modifies the failure messages for RSpec\u2019s built-in matchers    so that key words belonging to the \u201cexpected\u201d and \u201cactual\u201d values    get recolored.

This method delegates to <code>SuperDiff::Core::DifferDispatcher.call</code>,    which looks for a differ via <code>SuperDiff.configuration</code>    which is suitable for the pair.    It does this by calling <code>.applies_to?</code> on each one,    passing the <code>expected</code> and <code>actual</code>;    the first differ for whom this method returns <code>true</code> wins.    (This is a common pattern throughout the codebase.)    In most cases, if no differs are suitable,    then an error is raised,    although this is sometimes overridden.</li> <li>Once a differ is found,    its <code>.call</code> method is called.    Since all differs inherit from <code>SuperDiff::Core::AbstractDiffer</code>,    <code>.call</code> always builds an operation tree,    but the type of operation tree to build    \u2014 or, more specifically, the operation tree builder subclass \u2014    is determined by the differ itself,    via the <code>#operation_tree_builder_class</code> method.    For instance,    <code>SuperDiff::Basic::Differs::Array</code> uses a <code>SuperDiff::Basic::OperationTreeBuilders::Array</code>,    <code>SuperDiff::Basic::Differs::Hash</code> uses a <code>SuperDiff::Basic::OperationTreeBuilders::Hash</code>,    etc.</li> <li>Once the differ has an operation tree builder,    the differ calls <code>.call</code> on it    to build an operation tree.    Different operation tree builders do different things    depending on the types of objects,    but the end goal is to iterate over both the expected and actual values in tandem,    find the differences between them,    and represent those differences as operations.    An operation may be one of four types:    <code>:insert</code>, <code>:delete</code>, <code>:change</code>, or <code>:noop</code>.    In the case of collections \u2014    which covers most types of values \u2014    the diff is performed recursively.    This means that just as collections can have multiple levels,    so too can operation trees.</li> <li>Once the differ has an operation tree,    it then calls <code>#to_diff</code> on it.    This method is defined in <code>SuperDiff::Core::AbstractOperationTree</code>,    and it starts by first flattening the tree.</li> <li>This means that we need an operation tree flattener class.    Like differs,    operation trees specify which operation tree flattener they want to use    via the <code>operation_tree_flattener_class</code> method.</li> <li>Once the operation tree has a flattener class,    it calls <code>.call</code> on the class    to flatten the tree.</li> <li>Different types of flatteners also do different things,    but most of them operate on collection-based operation trees.    Since operation trees can have multiple level,    the flattening must be performed recursively.    The end result is a list of Line objects.</li> <li>Once the operation tree has been flattened,    then if the user has configured the gem to do so,    a step is performed to look for unchanged lines    (that is, operations of type <code>:noop</code>)    and elide them \u2014    collapse them in such a way that the surrounding context is still visible.</li> <li>Once a set of elided lines is obtained,    the operation tree runs them through <code>SuperDiff::Core::TieredLinesFormatter</code>,    which will add the <code>-</code>s and <code>+</code>s along with splashes of color    to create the final format you see at the very end.</li> </ol> <p>In summary:</p> <pre><code>graph TB\n  DifferDispatcher -- Configured differs --&gt; Differ;\n  Differ -- Operation tree builder --&gt; OperationTree[Operation tree];\n  OperationTree -- Operation tree flattener --&gt; Lines;\n  Lines -- Tiered lines elider --&gt; ElidedLines[Elided lines];\n  ElidedLines -- Tiered lines formatter --&gt; FinalDiff[Diff string];</code></pre>"},{"location":"contributors/architecture/introduction/","title":"Architecture","text":"<p>The SuperDiff codebase is sufficiently complex that diving into the source code for the first time may be daunting.</p> <p>This section aims to point contributors in the right direction.

RSpec has many nice features, and one of them is that whenever you use a matcher such as <code>eq</code>, <code>match</code>, <code>include</code>, or <code>have_attributes</code>, you will get a diff of the two data structures you are trying to match against. This is great if all you want to do is compare multi-line strings. But if you want to compare other, more \u201creal world\u201d kinds of values such as API or database data, then you are out of luck. Since RSpec merely runs your <code>expected</code> and <code>actual</code> values through Ruby\u2019s PrettyPrinter library and then performs a diff of these strings, the output it produces leaves much to be desired.</p> <p>For instance, let\u2019s say you wanted to compare these two hashes:</p> <pre><code>actual = {\n  customer: {\n    person: SuperDiff::Test::Person.new(name: \"Marty McFly, Jr.\", age: 17),\n    shipping_address: {\n      line_1: \"456 Ponderosa Ct.\",\n      city: \"Hill Valley\",\n      state: \"CA\",\n      zip: \"90382\"\n    }\n  },\n  items: [\n    { name: \"Fender Stratocaster\", cost: 100_000, options: %w[red blue green] },\n    { name: \"Mattel Hoverboard\" }\n  ]\n}\n\nexpected = {\n  customer: {\n    person: SuperDiff::Test::Person.new(name: \"Marty McFly\", age: 17),\n    shipping_address: {\n      line_1: \"123 Main St.\",\n      city: \"Hill Valley\",\n      state: \"CA\",\n      zip: \"90382\"\n    }\n  },\n  items: [\n    { name: \"Fender Stratocaster\", cost: 100_000, options: %w[red blue green] },\n    { name: \"Chevy 4x4\" }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>If, somewhere in a test, you were to say:</p> <pre><code>expect(actual).to eq(expected)\n</code></pre> <p>You would get output that looks like this:</p> <p></p> <p>What this library does is to provide a diff engine that knows how to figure out the differences between any two data structures and display them in a sensible way.
